### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roberto Alsina. You can find me at my website: https://ralsina.me or follow me on twitter.com/ralsina or watch videos (in spanish) at https://www.youtube.com/oldguyattheterminal ... here are lots of code in different states of disrepair. Actual useful projects I started have their own organizations, such as github.com/getnikola or github.com/rst2pdf
