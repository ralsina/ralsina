### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Roberto Alsina. You can find me at my website: [ralsina.me](https://ralsina.me) or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ralsina) or watch my videos (in spanish) at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/oldguyattheterminal) 

Here are lots of code in different states of disrepair. Actual useful projects I started have their own organizations, such as [Nikola](https://github.com/getnikola) or [rst2pdf](https://github.com/rst2pdf)
